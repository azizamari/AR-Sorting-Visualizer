# AR Visualizer
#### This app was developed by [Aziz amari](https://azizamari.cf) as submission for [AlgoExpert's contest](https://www.algoexpert.io/swe-project-contests/2020-summer)
## Purpose
AR Visualizer is a project aimed at showcasing how famous algorithms (e.g: Bubble Sort, Shell Sort,...) work in a more immersive experience using "Augmented Reality" technologies.
## Technologies i used
* C# (Programming language)
* Unity (Game engine)
* Arcore (Google's augmented reality SDK)
## Features
* Scan flat surfaces with your mobile phone's camera.
* Spawn "Bar Graphs" on top of scanned surfaces to use them for visualizations.
* Manipulate your "Bar Graphs" using phone touch:
  * Select which object you want to manipulate by tapping on it.
  * Rotate your object on Y axis by twisting two fingers in desired direction.
  * Move your object by holding your finger on desired object and then dragging it around.
* Delete "Bar Graphs" by selecting them and then pressing the "Delete" button on top right corner.
* Changing the algorithm used for sorting by a drop down list (currently we have: Bubble Sort, Shell Sort and Selection Sort)
